Iris Keyboard Case
==================

Here's case design files for the [Iris](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard). It's a sandwich-style case with cutouts to accomodate the USB jack and the TRRS jack.

Case pieces
-----------
The Iris sandwich case consists these pieces:

- Switch plate (Required)
- Bottom plate (Required)
- Middle layer (Optional)
- Top rim or Top shell (Optional)

### Compatibility info for Rev. 2 and Rev. 3/4
The following pieces are the same for Rev. 2 and 3/4 and have been placed in the top-level directory:

- Switch plate
- Top rim
- Top shell

Rev. 3 and Rev. 4 use the same parts, as they both have the same dimensions.

The following pieces are different between revisions and have their on directories ([rev2-only](rev2-only/) and [rev3-only](rev3-only/)):
- Middle layer
- Bottom plate

### Additional notes
Some of the files only have a left half, just mirror the file to produce a right half if needed.

Design info
-----------
A lot of these files have been derived from the following file: [iris-plate-design-rev2-and-rev3.ai](iris-plate-design-rev2-and-rev3.ai). By toggling various layers in that file, you can see various info on switch cutouts, screw holes, inner/outer edges, etc.

Screws and Standoffs
--------------------
This case was designed to use M2 screws and standoffs. The holes in the middle layers are for the standoffs, while the holes in the top and bottom layers are only wide enough for the screws. M2 screws and standoffs that fit the case can be purchased at Keebio: [M2 Screws & Standoffs](https://keeb.io/products/m2-screws-and-standoffs)

Fabrication
-----------

### Sculpteo
[Sculpteo](https://www.sculpteo.com) offers laser cutting services and is relatively easy to use.

Steps:
- Upload file
- Scale the object correctly, the dimensions of the various layers are as follows:
    - Exterior screw top/bottom plates: 153.7mm x 133.9mm
    - Middle layer (non-tented) is 153.7mm x 132.5mm
    - Middle layer (tented) is 167.2mm x 132.5mm
    - Interior screw top/bottom plates: 144.45mm x 123.0mm
- Make sure all colors are set to "Cut" and not any of the engraving choices
- Select your material and order

### Ponoko
To have the case made with Ponoko, you can't take these files as is and send them off to them. First, you'll need to download the templates for P1, P2, & P3 sheets from here, depending on what vector editor you are using:

- [Inkscape templates](https://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/inkscape)
- [Adobe Illustrator template](https://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/adobe-illustrator)
- [Other](https://www.ponoko.com/make-and-sell/design-it-yourself)

Next, open up the template of the sheet size you want and open up the case design files as well. Then, copy the drawings in the case design files into the template. Remove any overlapping lines to reduce the cutting cost using this guide: [Avoid doubled up lines](http://support.ponoko.com/hc/en-us/articles/220289608-Avoid-doubled-up-blue-cutting-lines-in-your-designs).

### Middle Layer Thickness
If you're having the middle layers made, from the top of the switch plate to the top of the bottom plate, the minimium distance between the two required is 12mm if the plastic on the header pins is removed. The requirement is slightly more (about 13.5mm) if you leave the plastic on. Therefore, the following middle layer thickness are needed based on the thickness of the switch layer:

- 1.5mm Stainless steel switch plate: 10.5mm
    - Usually accomplished with:
        - 2x4.5mm + 1x1.5mm layers
        - or 3x3mm + 1x1.5mm layers
        - or 4x3mm layers
- 3mm acrylic switch plate: 9mm
    - Usually accomplished with:
        - 2x4.5mm layers
        - or 3x3mm layers

STL Files for 3D printing
-------------------------
A couple of STL files have also been included for the middle layers and are both single pieces.

One version allows the Ergodox EZ legs to be used with it. In addition to the legs, you'll need M3 nuts to allow the legs screws to screw into.

Community-Made Files
--------------------
Files not designed by Keebio are placed into the [community-made](community-made/) folder and also includes links to other designs not hosted in this repository.
